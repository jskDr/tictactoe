# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A Tictactoe game developed based on RL algorithms

## Main source: tictactoe.py
### Playing mode
- Play with Q-learning based Agent.
- Now, you can play with the CNN-DQN based AI-agent.
Not yet, DNN-DQN agent works. It will work soon. 

### Learning mode  
This mode has now two varitions as follows:
E-greedy is implemented for all following learning methods.
- MC backup 
- Q-learning
- Q-learning with variable epsilon.
- MLP-DQN with variable epsilon.
- CNN-DQN with variable epsilon, where CNN includes two convolutional layers with (2,2) filters.
Note that epsilon controls the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. Learning with the state-art best player will be implemented soon. 

### Testing mode
A few test modes are included.
